# Project Title - TODO List Smart Contract on Solana

## Project Description:
This project is a decentralized TODO List app built on the Solana blockchain, leveraging Web3 technologies. The app allows users to create, manage, check, and delete tasks in a secure and transparent manner. By using Solana's fast and scalable blockchain, users can interact with the smart contract efficiently, making it an ideal solution for managing tasks in a decentralized manner.

### Main Features:
1. Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the TODO List by submitting a transaction to the smart contract.
2. Check Tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking them off in the app.
3. Delete Tasks: Users have the option to delete completed or unneeded tasks from the list.

## Prerequisites:
### Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Basic knowledge of JavaScript, Solidity (or other smart contract languages), and Web3.
2. Install Node.js and npm.
3. Set up a Solana development environment and create a wallet.

## Installation:
### Provide clear instructions on how to set up the project locally.
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using npm.
3. Configure the Solana connection and wallet.
